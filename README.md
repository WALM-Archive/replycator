To work with the Twitter API, read the documentation on creating a Twitter App(note - making app starts from https://dev.twitter.com)

To activate sending messages in telegram, you need to create a bot via BotFather, add a bot to the telegram channel of the bot and make it an administrator. To find out the telegram ID of the channel, you need to forward a message from the channel to https://t.me/get_myidbot (note - the channel ID starts from -100)

The run rules are designed to check whether you are using this social network or telegram channel

To create a post with files and text, you need to write messages and send files to the bot's personal chat. You can use /help to find out the purpose of the commands
